# Install
- [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/aws-navbar-region-color/)
- [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ofhcnghdbkacblncbjjpcdfmbknhckkb)

## Reasons for the fork
- Other extension is not open source
- Other extension was broken by an update on AWS' side
- Adds new regions that were missing
- Adds support for Firefox
- Uses a color picker instead of asking the user to input hex
- Other extension requires a permission that lets it access your whole browsing history, this one doesn't

I believe that by making it open source it'll be possible to verify that the code doesn't do anything wrong such as exfiltrate data and if there's any further breakage people will be able to fix it by either contributing or forking it into a new version.

## Philosophy
All the extension code is kept extremely simple in order to allow anyone to contribute easily, this means:
- Uses no transpilation tools, only basic HTML and Javascript
- Only include minimal number of files
- Keep code extremely simple
